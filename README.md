# DMS
### Dungeon Master Service (dee-EMS) A working title.
#### By Kimberly Bordon
*A Dungeons & Dragons Campaign management application. Pen and paper is great, but for anyone who finds themselves wanting a more convenient, and centralized method of storing their world lore, and character data, I'm hoping this application can provide that service. I would like to make this application available as both a web, and native mobile application.*

* This application's intent is to allow a user to create a campaign, and designate themselves as DM of that campaign. As DM, they will have the sole privilege of editing world or npc (non-player character) data unless they specify otherwise.
* The DM is privy to that campaign knowledge, and can choose to share that data with their players.
* Users as Players can create characters, and then submit that character to the DM to approve as part of their campaign. Only the Player, and the DM have access to that character's data.

Beyond these core functionalities, I would also like to incorporate:
* Calls to a [D&D api](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to help the users as a reference tool
* allow direct messaging between players of the same Campaign and/or their campaign's DM
* Customizable dice rolling animations
* ... and much more! (because you can never have enough dreams, right?)

### Technology
* C#
* Visual Studio
* Xamarin
* TBA
